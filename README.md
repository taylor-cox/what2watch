## Description 
<!-- ðŸ§  -->
In 1999, the Oscar for Best Picture went to 'Shakespeare in Love', a beautiful, touching rom-com about a young Shakespeare falling in love while writing Romeo & Juliet. It was extremely successful in and out of the box office, and received acclaim from critics across the world. However, ask anyone born past the turn of the century and they'll look at you with confusion! It's fallen out of favor, a mere image (or, really, a mere set of sequential images) of what it once was, even with all the awards and acclaims it received. Hell, you'd be more likely to find people today who know 'Gnomeo & Juliet' over this Oscar winning, inspirational performance. You'd be hard-pressed to find it on any of the popular streaming sites. One might say it has become an embodiment of the phrase, ["This too shall pass"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass), and oh how much it expresses. <!-- it's a new, up-and-coming phrase I found on Google -->
 
Maybe, life is not about the admiration, awards and acclaims of yesteryear, but how they withstand the test of time and what you do with them. Maybe, spin-offs can be even more popular amongst certain audiences than their original inspirations. Maybe, imitating these works is in fact a form of flattery. <!-- A little off the mark but whatever. --> Maybe, you'll join us at **what2watch**, and find a âœ¨flawlessâœ¨ film worthy of your best regards.

I made this in ~2 days.

The website is disgusting, the database is unwieldy, and I have no informed opinion on Go.

## Getting Started
You need Docker and Docker Compose installed. Run:
```
docker compose up
```
in the root directory to start up the project. 

This was developed on Linux, it may not work on your platform.

On first run, the database will need to be populated. Follow the instructions in `database/db-populator` to do it.

## Additional Information
All the data comes from the [IMDB Database Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com).

The website sucks and probably won't work on all devices.
